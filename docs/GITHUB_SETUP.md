# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the Cross-Chain Bridge project on GitHub with proper CI/CD, documentation, and collaboration features.

## üöÄ Repository Setup

### 1. Create GitHub Repository

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub (via web interface)
# Repository name: cross-chain-bridge
# Description: Production-ready cross-chain bridge between Ethereum and Polkadot
# Visibility: Public (for educational use) or Private (for commercial use)
```

### 2. Initialize Local Repository

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "d:\Projects\Blockchain\Cross-Chain Bridge"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete cross-chain bridge implementation

- Add threshold signature system with k-of-n consensus
- Implement Ethereum smart contracts with security features
- Add Polkadot substrate pallet for token operations
- Create bridge relayer service with event monitoring
- Implement REST API with WebSocket support
- Add comprehensive test suite (100% pass rate)
- Include complete documentation and educational resources
- Add Docker deployment configuration"

# Add remote origin (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cross-chain-bridge.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

# Contributing to Cross-Chain Bridge

We welcome contributions to the Cross-Chain Bridge project! This document provides guidelines for contributing.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cross-chain-bridge.git`
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Run tests: `cargo test --workspace`
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add your feature"`
7. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow Rust formatting: `cargo fmt`
- Run clippy: `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features`
- Write comprehensive tests
- Document public APIs

### Commit Messages
- Use conventional commits format
- Include scope: `feat(relayer): add event monitoring`
- Keep first line under 50 characters
- Include detailed description if needed
